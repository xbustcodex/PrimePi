/**
 * The provider-usability authority.
 *
 * ## The defect this exists to close
 *
 * `disabledProviders` was enforced in exactly one place — `evaluateEligibility`,
 * the role-chain path (`packages/ai/src/utils/model-roles.ts:675`) — while four
 * other paths could still reach a disabled provider:
 *
 * - `ModelRuntime.updateModelSnapshot` filtered `available` on configured-auth or
 *   credential-free, never on disabled, so a disabled provider stayed a live
 *   failover candidate.
 * - `ModelRegistry.find` answered from the full catalog, so a literal
 *   `provider/id` recovered it.
 * - `getApiKeyForProvider` resolved auth unconditionally, so a request reached it
 *   and was given a credential.
 * - `resolvePlanExitTransition` restored a model captured before the provider was
 *   disabled.
 *
 * The upstream reference hit the identical defect and fixed it in `oh-my-pi`
 * commit `f10425abad` (PR #13194): with ambient AWS credentials, a
 * `retry.fallbackChains` entry naming an amazon-bedrock model sent the retry to
 * Bedrock despite `disabledProviders: [amazon-bedrock]`. Its fix was three
 * `isProviderDisabled` checks — the symptom-level version of this change, and
 * what would drift again on the next new path.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * **A disabled provider is unusable. Nothing about a model makes it otherwise.**
 *
 * Precedence is explicit and total:
 *
 * 1. `disabled` — the user turned the provider off. Beats everything below.
 * 2. `blocked-by-policy` — a paid model when policy forbids spending.
 * 3. `unreachable` — no credential, and the model is not served anonymously.
 * 4. `usable`.
 *
 * A **free or credential-free model on a disabled provider is still disabled.**
 * That is the case a naive filter misses, because "needs no credentials" and "the
 * user disabled it" look like the same fact and are not: the first is a property
 * of the model, the second is an instruction.
 *
 * ## Why one authority rather than four checks
 *
 * The four paths above are the ones that exist today. A fifth — a new resolver, a
 * new fallback, an extension path — would be added by someone who cannot see the
 * other four. A single predicate with one call site per consumer makes a leak a
 * missing call rather than a forgotten rule, and the tests assert the predicate
 * directly so its contract is stated once.
 *
 * ## Live reads, not captured sets
 *
 * Consumers take a {@link DisabledProvidersReader}, not a set. A captured set
 * makes a live settings change invisible to whichever consumer was constructed
 * first, so re-enabling a provider would depend on construction order. A reader
 * makes it immediate, which is what "re-enabling works without a restart" means.
 */

/**
 * Why a provider is or is not usable, in precedence order.
 *
 * The order is the rule. `disabled` outranks every other reason so a disabled
 * provider is never reported as merely unreachable: "you have no credential" and
 * "you turned this off" call for different user actions, and conflating them
 * makes a disable look like a login problem.
