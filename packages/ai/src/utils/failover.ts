/**
 * Automatic model failover: choosing a replacement model for an unfinished turn.
 *
 * Two invariants dominate the design.
 *
 * 1. **Free stays free.** When the active model is free and the policy is
 *    `free-only`, a paid model is never selected, even if one is reachable. Lack of
 *    a free route is reported as a clean stop, never as permission to spend money.
 *
 * 2. **Candidates must fit the turn.** Switching to an incompatible model would
 *    corrupt the reply, so tool-calling, modality, and context requirements are
 *    checked before a candidate is eligible.
 *
 * Candidates are ranked deterministically so a failover cycle is reproducible, and
 * every candidate already attempted in the cycle is excluded, which bounds the cycle
 * and makes A -> B -> A impossible.
