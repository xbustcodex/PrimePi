/**
 * Temporary unavailability tracking for automatic model failover.
 *
 * Different failures invalidate different amounts of the catalog, so exclusions are
 * keyed by the scope the provider reported rather than by a single global flag:
 *
 *   model        exclude one model
 *   route        exclude one model's upstream route
 *   funding-pool exclude every model that draws on the same account quota
 *   provider     exclude the whole provider
 *
 * A funding-pool exclusion is what stops Pi from cycling through every remaining
 * `:free` model on an account whose free quota is already spent: all of them share
 * the pool, so they are all unavailable for the same reason and at the same time.
 *
 * Expiries are absolute epoch milliseconds taken from the provider when it supplies
 * a reset time, so a clock that jumps cannot extend an exclusion indefinitely. When
 * no trustworthy reset is known, a bounded fallback keeps the entry from becoming
 * permanent, and the next real failure refreshes it.
