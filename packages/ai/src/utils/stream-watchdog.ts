/**
 * Stream watchdogs: bounding how long a model stream may stall.
 *
 * ## The failure
 *
 * A provider request that never produces an event hangs forever. The turn
 * never completes, the abort button is the only exit, and from the user's side
 * the session has simply stopped. There is no error and no trace, which is what
 * makes it worse than a failure: a failed request can be retried.
 *
 * Two separate bounds, because "no first event" and "silence in the middle" are
 * different failures with different costs. A first-event watchdog is generous —
 * some models think for a long time before emitting anything. An idle watchdog
 * is tight — once a stream is running, a long gap means it has ended without
 * saying so.
 *
 * ## The three states
 *
 * `-1` means *auto*: use the provider's own default, or the environment's. This
 * is the default and it is deliberately not a number, because a hard-coded
 * constant would override whatever the provider or operator configured.
 *
 * `0` means *disabled*. Not "immediate" — a zero timeout that aborted
 * instantly would make the watchdog fire on every request, and a user who
 * turned it off deserves silence rather than an error.
 *
 * A positive value is seconds, and the conversion is at least 1ms so a
 * fractional value cannot produce a zero deadline.
 *
 * ## Why the timer is refilled rather than absolute
 *
 * A deadline set once at the start of a request would abort a long but healthy
 * generation. The idle budget is per *gap*, not per request, so a stream that
 * emits steadily for ten minutes is never touched.

/**
 * Wraps a `fetch` so a stalled response body fails instead of hanging.
 *
 * ## Why the transport and not each adapter
 *
 * A stall is a property of the bytes, not of any provider's event grammar, so
 * the watchdog belongs where every HTTP-streaming adapter's body passes: the
 * fetch itself. Nine adapters call `buildBaseOptions`, which calls this once.
 * An adapter that issues no HTTP body — Bedrock, Vertex, the Codex WebSocket
 * path — is not covered here; those carry their own timers.
 *
 * ## Why `null` rather than an identity wrapper
 *
 * Several adapters branch on `options.fetch === globalThis.fetch` to detect an
 * injected implementation. Returning `null` when nothing is armed keeps that
 * comparison exact, so a default install is byte-for-byte the previous
 * transport.
 *
 * ## The error, not a silent end
 *
 * `withStreamWatchdog` reports a timeout through a callback because it has no
 * error channel of its own. A transport does: the guarded body is errored, so
 * the adapter's own stream handler sees a rejected read and emits its normal
 * `stopReason: "error"` terminal message. The message names the watchdog and
 * the gap. It never names a header, a URL, or a credential — the wrapper sees
 * only the response body, which is the point of putting the watchdog here
 * rather than in a layer that also handles authentication.
